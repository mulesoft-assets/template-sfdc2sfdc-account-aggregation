# Template: Salesforce Org to Org Account Aggregation

Aggregates accounts from multiple Salesforce orgs into a CSV file. You can modify this basic pattern to collect from more or different sources, and to produce formats other than CSV. You can trigger this manually or programmatically with an HTTP call. 

Accounts are sorted such that the accounts only in Org A appear first, followed by accounts only in Org B, and lastly by accounts found in both orgs. The custom sort or merge logic can be easily modified to present the data as needed. This template also serves as a base for building APIs using the Anypoint Platform.

Aggregation templates can be easily extended to return a multitude of data in mobile friendly form to power your mobile initiatives by providing easily consumable data structures from otherwise complex backend systems.

**Note:** Any references in the video to DataMapper have been updated in the template with DataWeave transformations.

# Use Case

As a Salesforce administrator, I want to aggregate accounts from two Salesforce instances and compare them to see which accounts can only be found in one of the two and which accounts are in both instances. 

This template generates the result a CSV report that is sent by email to addresses you configure.

This template extracts data from two systems, aggregates data, compares values of fields for the objects, and generates a CSV report of the differences.

As implemented, it gets accounts from two instances of Salesforce, compares by the name of the accounts, and generates a CSV file which shows accounts in A, accounts in B, and accounts in A and B. The report is then emailed to a configured group of email addresses.

# Considerations

To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made for all to run smoothly.

Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.

## Salesforce Considerations

Here's what you need to know about Salesforce to get this template to work.

### FAQ

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: [Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US "Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field")
- Can I modify the Field Access Settings? How? See: [Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US "Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings")

### As a Data Source

If the user who configured the template for the source system does not have at least _read only_ permissions for the fields that are fetched, then an _InvalidFieldFault_ API fault displays.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault [ApiFault  
exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='
Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting 
to use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom 
field name. Reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]
]
```

### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using Salesforce as a data destination.

# Run it!

Simple steps to get Salesforce Org to Org Account Aggregation running.

## Running On Premises

Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in mule.prod.properties and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this is `mule.env=prod`.

After this, to trigger the use case, browse to the local HTTP endpoint with the port you configured in your file. For example if you use `9090` for the port, browse to `http://localhost:9090/generatereport` and the application creates a CSV report and sends it to the configured emails.

### Where to Download Anypoint Studio and the Mule Runtime

If you are a newcomer to Mule, here is where to get the tools.

- [Download Anypoint Studio](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio)
- [Download Mule runtime](https://www.mulesoft.com/lp/dl/mule-esb-enterprise)

### Importing a Template into Studio

In Studio, click the Exchange X icon in the upper left of the taskbar, log in with your

Anypoint Platform credentials, search for the template, and click **Open**.

### Running on Studio

After you import your template into Anypoint Studio, follow these steps to run it:

- Locate the properties file `mule.dev.properties`, in src/main/resources.
- Complete all the properties required as per the examples in the "Properties to Configure" section.
- Right click the template project folder.
- Hover your mouse over `Run as`
- Click `Mule Application (configure)`
- Inside the dialog, select Environment and set the variable `mule.env` to the value `dev`
- Click `Run`

### Running on Mule Standalone

Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in mule.prod.properties and run your app with the corresponding environment variable. To follow the example, this is `mule.env=prod`. 

## Running on CloudHub

While creating your application on CloudHub (or you can do it later as a next step), go to Runtime Manager > Manage Application > Properties to set the environment variables listed in "Properties to Configure" as well as the **mule.env**.

After you have your app running, if you chose `sfdc2sfdc-accounts-aggregation` as the domain name to trigger the use case browse to `http://sfdc2sfdc-accounts-aggregation.cloudhub.io/generatereport` and report is sent to the emails configured.

### Deploying your Anypoint Template on CloudHub

Studio provides an easy way to deploy your template directly to CloudHub, for the specific steps to do so check this

# API Calls

Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API calls that can be made. However, this template

only makes one API call to Salesforce during aggregation.

# Customize It!

This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.

As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template.

More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

- config.xml
- businessLogic.xml
- endpoints.xml
- errorHandling.xml

## config.xml

Configuration for connectors and configuration properties are set in this file. Even change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified are in properties file, which is the recommended place to make your changes. However if you want to do core changes to the logic, you need to modify this file.

In the Studio visual editor, the properties are on the _Global Element_ tab.

## businessLogic.xml

The functionality of this template is implemented in the XML, directed by a flow responsible for conducting the aggregation of data, comparing records, and finally formating the output, in this case being a report.

Using the Scatter-Gather component, this template queries the data in different systems. After that the aggregation is implemented in a DataWeave 2 script using the Transform component.

Aggregated results are sorted by:

1. Accounts only in Salesforce A
2. Accounts only in Salesforce B
3. Accounts in both Salesforce A and Salesforce B

The result is transformed to CSV format. The final report in CSV format is sent to the email addresses  you configured in the `mule.*.properties` file.

## endpoints.xml

This is the file where you find the endpoint to start the aggregation. This template uses an HTTP Listener to trigger the use case.

### Trigger Flow

**HTTP Listener** - Start Report Generation

- `${http.port}` is set as a property to be defined either on a property file or in CloudHub environment variables.
- The path configured by default is `generatereport` and you are free to change as you prefer.
- The host name for all endpoints in your CloudHub configuration is `localhost`. CloudHub then routes requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint.

## errorHandling.xml

This is the right place to handle how your integration reacts depending on the different exceptions.

This file provides error handling that is referenced by the main flow in the business logic.
